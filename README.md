# microservice-with-EKS-jenkins
we’ll explore how deploying a microservice application on an Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster using Jenkins not only enhances the effectiveness of the deployment process but also ensures a scalable and resilient application infrastructure. We’ll dive into the specifics of leveraging Jenkins for CI/CD, utilizing Kubernetes for container orchestration, and how these tools together create a streamlined and robust deployment strategy for modern applications.

##To create EKS cluster
eksctl create cluster --name EKS-1 --region us-east-1
